<h3>HOT TO</h3>
<p>SOLO GAME: you are the black square; use key arrows to move and eat the green squares (+10); if you hit a red square you die; if you move to a white square you lose 10 points; finishing all the squares grants a win (+100); best score possible is 220;</p>
<p>TRAIN BOT: agent plays for 100000 steps by itself; result is stored in memory and in local storage under 'localstorage://qliaModel'; it should require around 15-20mins depending on the browser and hardware; should lead to perfect play;</p>
<p>START BOT: tries to get the agent from the local storage; if this is not found, tries to take it from memory; if not found, a new agent is created; one game is then played and displayed;</p>
